# Data Type Inspector

This is an interactive web-application hosted on Github Pages that allows
users to inspect and manipulate the underlying representations of the common
primitive data types. This currently supports unsigned integers, signed 
integers (using twos-complement), and floating point numbers (using the IEEE 754
standard).
